## Bot Framework

Azure Bot Service provides tools to build, test, deploy, and manage connect intelligent bots that interact naturally wherever your users are talking, from text/sms to Skype, Slack, Office 365 mail and other popular services. The modular and extensible BotBuilder SDK provides templates to create bots that provide speech, language understanding, question and answer, and more.
The Microsoft Bot Builder SDK is a powerful, easy-to-use framework that provides a familiar way for .NET and Node.js developers to develop bots. The Bot Builder SDK provides features that make interactions between bots and users much simpler. Bot Builder also includes an emulator for debugging your bots, as well as a large set of sample bots you can use as building blocks.
