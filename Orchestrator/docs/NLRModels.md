# Prebuilt Language Models

Prebuilt language models have been trained towards more sophisticated tasks for both monolingual as well as multilingual scenarios, including intent prediction and entity extraction.
Entity extraction is currently experimental and not yet for production use.

The public preview of Orchestrator includes the following prebuilt language models available in [versions repository][2].

## Default Models

### pretrained.20200924.microsoft.dte.00.06.en.onnx
This is a high quality EN-only base model for intent detection that strikes the balance between size,
speed and predictive performance.
It is a 6-layer pretrained [Transformer][7] model optimized for conversation.
Its architecture is pretrained for example-based use ([KNN][3]),
thus it can be used out of box. This is the default model used if none explicitly specified.

### pretrained.20210205.microsoft.dte.00.06.unicoder_multilingual.onnx
This is a high quality multilingual base model for intent detection. It's smaller and faster than its 12-layer alternative.
It is a 6-layer pretrained pretrained [Transformer][7] model optimized for conversation.
Its architecture is pretrained for example-based use ([KNN][3]), thus it can be used out of box. The model supports in total 100 languages, with 8 of them (EN, ES, DE, FR, IT, JA, PT, and ZH) we believe of [high performance](#multilingual-intent-detection-models-evaluation). The full list of languages supported by the model can be found at [XLMR Supported Languages][8]. 

## Alternate Models

### pretrained.20200924.microsoft.dte.00.03.en.onnx
This is a fast and small EN-only base model for intent detection with sufficient prediction performance.
We suggest using this model if speed and memory size is critical to your deployment environment,
otherwise consider other options. It is a generic 3-layer pretrained
[Transformer][7] model optimized for conversation.
Its architecture is pretrained for example-based use ([KNN][3]), thus it can be used out of box.

### pretrained.20200924.microsoft.dte.00.12.en.onnx
This is a high quality EN-only base model for intent detection, but is larger and slower than other options.
It is a 12-layer pretrained pretrained [Transformer][7] model optimized for conversation.
Its architecture is pretrained for example-based use ([KNN][3]), thus it can be used out of box.

### pretrained.20201210.microsoft.dte.00.12.unicoder_multilingual.onnx
This is a high quality multilingual base model for intent detection.
It is a 12-layer pretrained pretrained [Transformer][7] model optimized for conversation.
Its architecture is pretrained for example-based use ([KNN][3]), thus it can be used out of box. The model supports in total 100 languages, with 8 of them (EN, ES, DE, FR, IT, JA, PT, and ZH) we believe of [high performance](#multilingual-intent-detection-models-evaluation). The full list of languages supported by the model can be found at [XLMR Supported Languages][8].
